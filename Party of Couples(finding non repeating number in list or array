class Solution:
    def findSingle(self, N, arr):
        # code here
        ans = 0
        for i in range(0, N):
            ans = ans ^ arr[i]
        return ans
        
^  IS XOR Operation
why should we do Xor to perform this code:

The XOR operation has a property such that if you XOR a number with itself, the answer becomes zero. 
So, we can do the XOR of all the elements in the array one by one, and then the final result would be our number that occurs once in the array.
